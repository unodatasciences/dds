### Academic and Professional Experience
Cong Wang received a M.S. and Ph.D. in Mathematics with a concentration in Mathematical Statistics from the New Mexico State University, in 2016 and 2020, respectively. She also received another M.S. in Applied Mathematics from Northwest A&F University, China, in 2016. In August of 2020, Cong began as an Assistant Professor at the department of Mathematics at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. 

Cong’s research interests cover several aspects on skew normal families, mainly about parameters estimations by a priori procedure and multivariate linear models on skew normal populations. For example, she has set up the a priori procedure (APP) for estimating location, scale, correlation coefficients and so on, both in the normal and the skew normal assumptions, which is an alternative to the traditional significance tests. Recently, the APP has been extended to one-way ANOVA with skew normal random effects, which is more general than the normal ones.

During Cong’s Doctoral studies, she received the Graduate Tuition Fellowship, which covered her studies for the first three years. She also received the Anna Schrufer Kist Endowed Scholarship in the Fall of 2018 and 2019. During the last year of her Ph.D., Cong was selected to receive the Preparing Future Faculty Graduate Assistantship from the Graduate School in New Mexico State University.
