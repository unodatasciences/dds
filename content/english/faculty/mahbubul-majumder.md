### Academic and Professional Experience

Mahbubul is an Associate Professor of Statistics with an interest in the emerging field of data science. He received his Ph.D. in Statistics from Iowa State University in 2013 and his M.A. in Statistics from Ball State University. Mahbubul started his academic career at the University of Nebraska at Omaha in 2013 as an Assistant Professor of Data Science. He teaches data science courses at UNO where he also developed the data science program. 

His research interests include techniques of effective data visualization, statistical inference using graphics, exploratory data analysis, and statistical and machine learning tools/models to convert data into data products. His publication on visual statistical inference appears on the Journal of American Statistical Association as a featured article.
 
Mahbubul has about 20 years of experience in working with real data and data related technologies. He worked for various companies such as Travelers Insurance, Hy-Vee, and Novartis Pharmaceutical Company. He supervised at least 16 students on data analysis and visualization projects with local industries such as Union Pacific Railroad, TD Ameritrade, Methodist Health System, Omaha Public Power District, First National Bank, Claas of America, etc. Mahbubul helps local industries develop in-house data science teams and provides essential training in the field. He recently organized workshops for the First National Bank and U.S. Strategic Command. He is currently working to develop an intensive training program for Kiewit Corporation. He also has worked on multiple projects funded by the Nebraska Applied Research Institute.
