### Academic and Professional Experience
Becky joined the Data and Decision Sciences Lab and the department of Mathematics at the University of Nebraska at Omaha as an Instructor in 2019. She received a M.S. in Mathematics with a concentration in Data Science from the University of Nebraska at Omaha in 2016, and a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of North Dakota in 1986. Becky worked for 15 years in software application development in the healthcare industry on both civilization and DoD projects. After earning her M.S., Becky worked as a Data Scientist and Operations Research Developer at Unigroup QDivision and their startup Handle.com.

Becky is part of a research team that has been awarded an NSF grant on Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE). Becky is the designer and instructor of the new class STAT 1100 Data Literacy and Visualization at UNO. This class is designed to fulfill the undergraduate general education requirement of quantitative literacy. The NSF research surrounds the implementation of Service Learning into the curriculum. The goal is to show that students are more successful in college when classes have real life investment through community partners. 

Becky is a dedicated instructor with a focus in adult education. Previously, she taught for more than 20 years at the Metropolitan Community College where she received the Entrepreneurship Award for the Business Math curriculum and support materials she designed. While in graduate school at UNO, Becky earned a spot in the international poster competition at the INFORMS Annual Meeting.
