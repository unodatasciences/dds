### About Me

Andrew is an Associate Professor in the department of Mathematical and Data Sciences at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, having joined the department in 2006. He received a DSc. in Operations Research from George Washington University, and a M.A. and B.A. in Mathematics from Oxford University. He previously was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. During his career, he has taught a variety of statistics, operations research, and mathematics courses. 

Andrewâ€™s research includes both theoretical and applied topics in statistics and operations research. His theoretical research includes work on such topics as discrete distribution approximation and flexible count distributions. His applied research includes data analysis on topics such as mammal biology, sports, and mathematical education. Andrew also has work as a consultant on several projects and has made several media appearances as a subject matter expert.

Andrew is a member of the American Statistical Association and the International Statistical Institute. He serves as an associate editor of the Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports and is a recipient of the Simons Foundation collaboration grant in mathematics.
